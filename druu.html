       A cute breed of monkey or we can say aasman se aayi hue jaadui paari. She is calm , she is cute , she understands others pain. She doesn't keep anything in mind about what she feels about others. She is purest form of a very great friend. Pheith piche kuch nhi bolegi joh hai muh pai bolti hai. Sometimes maybe she insults you but its for your good, she cares but never express that.

      But ye sab krke bhi people's doesn't understand her they thinks she gets rude. But in deep only she know what she is doing for you . She keeps her pain with her , though she shares everything with her mother but maybe (see haa am specifically mentioning "maybe") there would be something she can't shares with her mom. She helps others when they are in problem or trauma but when it's with her she doesn't share she decides to suffer alone all the pain . Idk about what others think about her but to me she is the best strong fighter girl. Who can deal with anything, who doesn't need any help from other like strong lioness.
